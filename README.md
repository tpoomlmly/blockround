# Blockround

An alternative client for the [Round app](https://round.app/) that lets you order food and drink from local bars and restaurants.

I've reverse engineered the Round API to make a Minecraft mod with the same features of the app. The payment screen opens in the browser, so you don't have to worry about putting your credit card details into a random mod.

## Features
### Bar sign
Place this on the ground and select a venue. It'll show the venue's name and logo.

### Menu
Use this on a bar sign to link it to a venue. Use it to place your order. It opens a checkout page in the browser at payment time.

### Pager
You get this when you place an order. It flashes shows you the status of your order and when it's done it disappears from your inventory.



Most of the stuff isn't done yet but it's getting there. Extra things I want to add:
- Cryptocurrency payments
- Pool
- Darts
- Karaoke
